From fiercely independent productions (Duvidha, Nainsukh) to self-funded <br>projects by reputable names (Pyaasa, Saptapadi) to modern big budget entertainers (Okkadu, Sarpatta Parambarai), with even a \"Cinema of Prayoga\" (Om Dar-B-Dar) in the midst! And my favourite picks are two astonishing works of self-reflexive art: Ritwik Ghatak's Jukti Takko aar Gappo, a work of self- flagellation and renunciation, and Payal Kapadia's fairly recent A Night of Knowing Nothing, the boldest debut by any filmmaker in recent times.<br><br>Still, there's room for more, so here goes three honourary mentions: Madhumati, a trendsetter, Om Shanti Om, its follower, and Deewar, a classic Bollywood masaala.

If I were to put myself in the mindset of evaluating a film in terms of traditional beauty, achievement in acting, clarity and complexity of acting, I think Dil Se is \"the best\" film I've ever seen. Mani Ratnam's master work, a compelling story about political radicalization and imperialism, and the best album of the 90s in its soundtrack, just an unbelievable film. Cemented my view of SRK as our finest living actor, and among the bravest moves by such a powerful movie star.<br><br>Om Shanti Om -The phrase \"a love letter to X\" is overused in these nostalgia heavy days, but Om Shanti Om is a film which truly overflows with adoration for its subject matter and it's just infectious. It's a perfect movie if you've never seen a Bollywood film, as it is for most of my friends I introduce it too, and it's perfect the more you know about Hindi film from the 70s onwards. Farah Khan's expertise as a choreographer translates to a chemically perfect sense of movement and photography. The songs are, of course, astounding. On a personal note, I will always associate it with a moment of my truly coming out as trans, not just self-IDing, but no more stealthing, being public, got into a good relationship, I spent the rest of the year fully SRK obsessed, it felt like the beginning of a wave that carried me through this year and crested with Jawan. <br><br>Anniyan - No movie does the whole Shankar thing better than Anniyan. The heights of every conceivable emotion and melodrama emphasized for maximal impact, with romance, action, comedy, horror, absurdity, INCREDIBLE songs by Harris Jayaraj. It's a film that is simply never consent to sit still when it could be sprinting through it's maniacal take on vigilante politics. <br><br>Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kaadhal - The film that made me fall in love with all three stars and Anirudh, still imo his best and most dynamic work. The hardest I've laughed at an Indian film in the past year, excellent cinematography, and a wonderfully constructed melodrama that turns the classic trope of \"two girls fight over a guy\" on its head in a surprisingly queer affirming way. <br><br>Tumbbad - I'm a horror fan first and a cinema fan second if I'm being honest. Horror is my lifeblood, and Tumbbad is the scariest movie from India I've seen. Super compelling folk horror.<br><br>Highway - Embraces the beauty of the natural world and trading different kinds of abuse. <br><br>Jawan - Okay I promised no more than 3 SRK movies but jesus CHRIST. The massiest of mass films heralded by the king himself, an unparalleled theater experience of raw excitement, pitch perfect star masturbation, visionary direction, and a surprisingly politically savvy storyline that smartly tweaks the angry young men cinema kept alive by Atlee's mentor Shankar. An incredible work that felt like a culmination of so many different things in my life when I saw it, and it's also because of Jawan that I met my current partner which honestly means that indirectly it saved my life so. I owe a lot to this little picture. <br><br>Vikram - One of the most tightly locked in crime thrillers in recent memory, excited to revisit it with a lot more Kamal Haasan context (my 2024 project)<br><br>Natchathiram Nagargiradhu - TRANS RIGHTS").

Same reason this list is actually unranked because that would just be a fool's errand. Some notes on my picks and what they mean to me. <br>1. Charulata - “Madame Bovary, c'est moi,” - Flaubert, \"Flaubert, c'est moi,\" - Chabrol, \"Charulata, c'est moi.\"<br>2. Pestonjee - a unicorn of a film that offers a vivid glimpse into the tiniest, least penetrable community in bombay [they literally live in walled colonies]. also my friend Evan needs to be quoted here when he said, \"Acting is Naseeruddin Shah making Hero Hiralal and Pestonjee in the same year.<br>3. Ajantrik - just realizing that the first 3 films on my list are all in some ways about loneliness and being inextricably drawn to someone or something that seems to offer some promise of something better. best supporting actor award to jagaddal. <br>4. Perumthachan - maybe perumthachan follows that theme too. watched this with mom on our most recent trip to india. full circle to where it all started - watching malayalam films with her when i was too young to understand them. <br>5. Aag - cinema is raj kapoor pulling nargis by her curls closer to him and nargis repeating what he has that no one else does - \"golden hair and your blue eyes\"<br>6. Deewaar - spent a large chunk of my childhood hoping to marry amitabh bachchan until my dad reminded me that they are the same age. not sholay but this is the one with all the iconic memorable lines and scenes for me. obvious double feature with james gray's we own the night.<br>7. Jait re Jait - r.i.p smita. impossible for me to pick one performance that defines her but between the impeccable cast & crew, that iconic unforgettable sdtrk and those godd*** bees, i go with this one.<br>8. Joker - murugan saar, i don't get your roberto benigni fixation but if this is what came out of you watching those movies, then pls watch on. also, i named my freelance business after a song from this film. also this film made it to this list replacing another film whose cd cover i actually got tattooed on my arm. <br>9. Rangeela - everyone else can keep their ddlj but to me it was always rangeela as the one of only 3 movies that my family took us to watch that year.<br>10. Guide - read the book every single summer growing up. a tattered copy belonging to my uncle who passed away too young because he was born with a hole in his heart. i was always told that i reminded everyone in the family of him making that book especially precious to me. i had never known anyone with an english name at the time and rosie seemed so glamorous. pity what happened with rk narayan and navketan but i love the film changes and all. just wish i identified more with rosie than raju guide though.
