    <h1>Notes from the organizer</h1>
    <p>It is my pleasure to reveal the results of this poll on P. Ranjith's birthday.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Anand from the Discord server for proposing this idea, filmisconstant and azad for helping me hammer out the initial details for this.</p>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who participated in this poll. We have had 22 voters on this year's poll, who voted for 147 unique movies in total.</p>
    <p>
    <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
    <p>The code and data for this website project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/razetime/indian-cinema-poll/">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>The data from the poll results can be seen in data.csv, in its raw format.</p>
    <p>The data is parsed in <code>conv.rb</code>, and the movie and voter data is stored as prolog data in <code>data2.P</code>.
    Prolog is a programming language that I find is good for reasoning and generating text.</p>
    <p>Generation of the movie related pages (ranking, who voted) is done in <code>genm.P</code> and voter related pages (list, personal notes) in <code>genv.P</code>.</p>
    <p>The final list is ranked using a Borda Count ranking system, which is a facy way to say that the first movie in your list gets 10 points, the next one 9 points, and so on.
    This system is better when the voter to movie ratio is around 1/5, the ranking hence may be somewhat skewed. But then again, ranking movies using numbers or other objective isn't particularly accurate anyway.
    I hope the results are not too controversial.</p>
    <p>This project was made over the course of three days, where I certainly realized that my prolog skills were inadequate for web oriented work.
    It was certainly newer to me than I expected, and not as easy as I thought. However, it was still very fun to do and I'm very happy that I
    was able to do some coding work that wasn't the usual stuff I deal with in academia.</p>
    <p>Some portions of the site and its design have come out a bit amateurish due to real life stress. I am still open to any suggestions or problem reports on Discord.</p>
    <p>I hope I can run this poll again next year, in better form, with more voters, with more beautiful entries of Indian cinema to explore in the endless sea. May there be a free Palestine the next time we run this poll.</p>
