From fiercely independent productions (Duvidha, Nainsukh) to self-funded 
projects by reputable names (Pyaasa, Saptapadi) to modern big budget entertainers (Okkadu, Sarpatta Parambarai), with even a ""Cinema of Prayoga"" (Om Dar-B-Dar) in the midst! And my favourite picks are two astonishing works of self-reflexive art: Ritwik Ghatak's Jukti Takko aar Gappo, a work of self- flagellation and renunciation, and Payal Kapadia's fairly recent A Night of Knowing Nothing, the boldest debut by any filmmaker in recent times.

Still, there's room for more, so here goes three honourary mentions: Madhumati, a trendsetter, Om Shanti Om, its follower, and Deewar, a classic Bollywood masaala. With the inclusion of these three, my list finally feels complete."
