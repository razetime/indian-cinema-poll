Turns out they are all great films too of course. Narrowing down one of if not the most prolific and vibrant film industries in the world to just 10 films meant that the list had to be necessarily personal. Same reason this list is actually unranked because that would just be a fool's errand. Some notes on my picks and what they mean to me. <br>1. Charulata - “Madame Bovary, c'est moi,” - Flaubert, "Flaubert, c'est moi," - Chabrol, "Charulata, c'est moi."<br>2. Pestonjee - a unicorn of a film that offers a vivid glimpse into the tiniest, least penetrable community in bombay [they literally live in walled colonies]. also my friend Evan needs to be quoted here when he said, "Acting is Naseeruddin Shah making Hero Hiralal and Pestonjee in the same year.<br>3. Ajantrik - just realizing that the first 3 films on my list are all in some ways about loneliness and being inextricably drawn to someone or something that seems to offer some promise of something better. best supporting actor award to jagaddal. <br>4. Perumthachan - maybe perumthachan follows that theme too. watched this with mom on our most recent trip to india. full circle to where it all started - watching malayalam films with her when i was too young to understand them. <br>5. Aag - cinema is raj kapoor pulling nargis by her curls closer to him and nargis repeating what he has that no one else does - "golden hair and your blue eyes"<br>6. Deewaar - spent a large chunk of my childhood hoping to marry amitabh bachchan until my dad reminded me that they are the same age. not sholay but this is the one with all the iconic memorable lines and scenes for me. obvious double feature with james gray's we own the night.<br>7. Jait re Jait - r.i.p smita. impossible for me to pick one performance that defines her but between the impeccable cast & crew, that iconic unforgettable sdtrk and those godd*** bees, i go with this one.<br>8. Joker - murugan saar, i don't get your roberto benigni fixation but if this is what came out of you watching those movies, then pls watch on. also, i named my freelance business after a song from this film. also this film made it to this list replacing another film whose cd cover i actually got tattooed on my arm. <br>9. Rangeela - everyone else can keep their ddlj but to me it was always rangeela as the one of only 3 movies that my family took us to watch that year.<br>10. Guide - read the book every single summer growing up. a tattered copy belonging to my uncle who passed away too young because he was born with a hole in his heart. i was always told that i reminded everyone in the family of him making that book especially precious to me. i had never known anyone with an english name at the time and rosie seemed so glamorous. pity what happened with rk narayan and navketan but i love the film changes and all. just wish i identified more with rosie than raju guide though. </p></div></body></html>
