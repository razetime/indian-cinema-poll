If I were to put myself in the mindset of evaluating a film in terms of traditional beauty, achievement in acting, clarity and complexity of acting, I think Dil Se is "the best" film I've ever seen. Mani Ratnam's master work, a compelling story about political radicalization and imperialism, and the best album of the 90s in its soundtrack, just an unbelievable film. Cemented my view of SRK as our finest living actor, and among the bravest moves by such a powerful movie star.<br><br>Om Shanti Om -The phrase "a love letter to X" is overused in these nostalgia heavy days, but Om Shanti Om is a film which truly overflows with adoration for its subject matter and it's just infectious. It's a perfect movie if you've never seen a Bollywood film, as it is for most of my friends I introduce it too, and it's perfect the more you know about Hindi film from the 70s onwards. Farah Khan's expertise as a choreographer translates to a chemically perfect sense of movement and photography. The songs are, of course, astounding. On a personal note, I will always associate it with a moment of my truly coming out as trans, not just self-IDing, but no more stealthing, being public, got into a good relationship, I spent the rest of the year fully SRK obsessed, it felt like the beginning of a wave that carried me through this year and crested with Jawan. <br><br>Anniyan - No movie does the whole Shankar thing better than Anniyan. The heights of every conceivable emotion and melodrama emphasized for maximal impact, with romance, action, comedy, horror, absurdity, INCREDIBLE songs by Harris Jayaraj. It's a film that is simply never consent to sit still when it could be sprinting through it's maniacal take on vigilante politics. <br><br>Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kaadhal - The film that made me fall in love with all three stars and Anirudh, still imo his best and most dynamic work. The hardest I've laughed at an Indian film in the past year, excellent cinematography, and a wonderfully constructed melodrama that turns the classic trope of "two girls fight over a guy" on its head in a surprisingly queer affirming way. <br><br>Tumbbad - I'm a horror fan first and a cinema fan second if I'm being honest. Horror is my lifeblood, and Tumbbad is the scariest movie from India I've seen. Super compelling folk horror.<br><br>Highway - Embraces the beauty of the natural world and trading different kinds of abuse. <br><br>Jawan - Okay I promised no more than 3 SRK movies but jesus CHRIST. The massiest of mass films heralded by the king himself, an unparalleled theater experience of raw excitement, pitch perfect star masturbation, visionary direction, and a surprisingly politically savvy storyline that smartly tweaks the angry young men cinema kept alive by Atlee's mentor Shankar. An incredible work that felt like a culmination of so many different things in my life when I saw it, and it's also because of Jawan that I met my current partner which honestly means that indirectly it saved my life so. I owe a lot to this little picture. <br><br>Vikram - One of the most tightly locked in crime thrillers in recent memory, excited to revisit it with a lot more Kamal Haasan context (my 2024 project)<br><br>Natchathiram Nagargiradhu - TRANS RIGHTS</p></div></body></html>
